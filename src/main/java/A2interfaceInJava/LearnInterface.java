package A2interfaceInJava;

// Normal methods are called concrete methods(with body).
//Interface can have only abstract methods or body less method
//Means we can not implement any methods or put body for a method in interface(until Java 1.6?)
//We can declare variables in interface but we need to initiate it then and there;(until Java 1.5)
//Variables defined in interfaces are final in nature, means we can not change the value in any of the following classes.
// We can not create variables or methods with protected or private access modifiers
// private - we can use it only inside that class.protected - protected is also we can use it only in the same class and 
//We can not create Object for Interface because it only has Abstract methods. Also we can create object only for classes not for interfaces
//Interface can not have constructors.
//If a class wants to inherit the property of an Interface, we need to use "implements" keyword.
//If we want to link a interface with another interface, we need to use "extends" keyword.
//Whenever a class implements an interface, it will force us to implement all the unimplemented methods in our class

//We can not create a static abstract/bodyless method in an interface but we can create it as a method.
//Interface let us to have methods with body but those methods should be either static or default method
//We can have static method in interface and we can call it in a following class by using interface name.
//We can access default method in implemented class by using object
//We create object for a class using interface as a reference 
//We can give an interface as a return type
//We can create a interface within a interface
