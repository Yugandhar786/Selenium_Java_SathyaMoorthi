public class StaticBasic {

//		* static is a keyword in java
//		* It can be used with both methods and variables
//		* static variables and methods are belongs to class
//		* This means, we don't need to create Object of an class to access static methods and variables inside a class
//		* In order to use the static variables and methods inside of a class, we can simply call the variable and method names.
//		* In order to use the static variables and methods outside of a class, we need to access it using it's respective Class Name
//		* static will be stored in heap memory
//		* we can not declare static variable inside a static or non static method 
//			* because scope of variable declared inside a method ends once the holding method get executed. (method behavior)
//			* static means, it belongs to the class, means it can be accessed by any methods of the class or other class (static behavior)
//			* Since method and static having exactly opposite behavior, we cant use static inside any method
	
//	After OOPS concept
//		* If we keep all the methods and variables of an class as static, that class is called tightly encapsulated class
//		* we can overload a static method but we can not override a static method
	
//	After interface
//		 * In interface, we can create a methods with body but that method should be either static or default
	
//	After Constructor
//		* We can not create static variables inside a constructor
//		* We can not keep constructor as static because both of them are belongs to the class only.
